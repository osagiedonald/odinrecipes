    <h2>Donut Magic</h2>
    <p>A doughnut or donut is a type of food made from leavened fried dough.It is popular in many countries and 
        is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, 
        food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. Doughnut is the traditional spelling, while donut is the 
        simplified version; the terms are used interchangeably.</p>

            <li>Water</li>

        <h3>COOKING STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the dough.</strong> The dough comes together with a mixer. You can also make the dough by hand, but it requires a bit of arm muscle. After the dough comes together in the mixing bowl, knead it for 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Let the dough rise. </strong> In a relatively warm environment, the dough rises in about 90 minutes <br>
                Punch down the dough to release the air.</li>
                <li><strong>Roll & cut into doughnuts.</strong> Roll the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut the doughnuts 
                    using a 3-3.5 inch doughnut cutter. Line 1-2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone 
                    baking mat. Place doughnuts (and doughnut holes!) onto the lined baking sheet, then lightly cover 
                    and allow to rest as you prepare the oil.</li>
