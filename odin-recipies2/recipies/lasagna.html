    <h1>LASAGNA</h1>

    <h2>Delicious Lasagna Dish</h2>
    <P>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical 
        <em>lasagna dish</em> which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, 
        such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</P>
        <h3>INDREDIENTS</h3>
        <UL>
<li>Lsagna noodles</li>
<li>4. Cloves garlic</li>
<li>Ground beef</li>
<li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </UL>
        <h3>COOKING STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Our sauce is made with a mix of ground beef and pork. This is OPTIONAL. If you do not like 
                pork you can definitely use beef to replace it, but the pork does add a traditional lasagna 
                flavour to the sauce.</li>
                <li>Most sauces use crushed tomatoes as a base, however we love mixing in a bottle of Passata 
                    (or American tomato sauce) to add richness.</li>
                    <li>Using tomato paste results in a thick and rich sauce. Do not skip this ingredient! 
                        We love using one with garlic and herbs, but plain is also fine.</li>
